# Better Book Query (Natural Language Processing / DeepSeek AI)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Technology:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Python  

Better Book Query is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to intelligently direct queries to the most appropriate database. This project is particularly useful in environments like **San Diego State University’s (SDSU) library**, where multiple databases are accessible for research. By leveraging **LLMs and RAG**, this model enhances information retrieval by selecting the best database and generating a contextually relevant response.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
SDSU and many other institutions have a vast collection of **digital and physical databases**. Searching through them manually can be inefficient. This project aims to:
- Develop a **query-routing system** that directs user queries to the most relevant database.
- Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand and categorize queries.
- Generate responses using **LLMs** that retrieve information from the selected database.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Initial Phase: Query Search System
Begin by creating a system that can **search a database** given a user query. This can involve:
- Using **Python libraries** for text parsing and search.
- Implementing **basic search algorithms** to match queries to relevant database entries.
- Controlling **input devices (mouse, keyboard)** to simulate database searches, if necessary.

### 2️⃣ Advanced Phase: Implementing RAG
Once the search system is functional, integrate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
- Train an **LLM model** to understand different types of queries.
- Design a **routing mechanism** that directs queries to the appropriate database.
- Enhance retrieval quality by **generating contextually relevant responses** based on database information.

## 📚 Use Case Example
1. A student enters: *"Find research papers on climate change impact in California."*
2. The system processes the query and determines the best database (e.g., *ScienceDirect* or *JSTOR*).
3. It retrieves relevant papers and generates a response summarizing key findings.
4. The user receives a **refined, database-driven answer** instead of manually searching multiple databases.
